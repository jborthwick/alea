# TODO

## Bugs
- [x] Allow holding all 5 dice on the first roll (currently can only hold after first roll completes, but should be able to hold all 5 if you want to keep them)

## Future Enhancements
- [x] Add haptic feedback on mobile when dice collide (Android only - iOS Safari doesn't support Vibration API)
- [x] Add tilt-based camera movement on mobile (removed - now using fixed overhead camera)
- [ ] Drag-to-roll gesture on desktop
